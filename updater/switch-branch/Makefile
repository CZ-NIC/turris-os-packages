define Package/switch-branch/description
  Turris OS is released in various branches (with different guarantees and levels
  of stability). This script allows simple switch between them and also between
  archived versions. You should know that while move to more unstable branches is
  commonly supported the opposite (while allowed by script) might be problematic.
  The same applies to version downgrades.
